  'Jenni Cadman is textile artist based in Dorset, UK who creates hangings, panels and artworks using free-machine embroidery. Drawing with the needle she builds layers of threads in broad painterly strokes and bold flowing lines.',
  'Jenni has worked as a designer maker since leaving Reigate School of Art & Design in 1980 where she trained in Printed Textiles Design. After 12 years working within the applied arts of glass and decorative paint finishes she returned to the world of textiles and took up stitching in earnest.',

  'At the turn of the millennium she started sketching the coast of Cornwall and it was during this period that her work began to significantly evolve. Drawing, printing and paper collage became a crucial part of her process and she not only found a new way of expressing herself but the key to developing her own style of embroidery.',

  'In the following two decades Jenni mainly concentrated on the landscape of Dorset for her inspiration, showing her textile art in solo and group shows within the UK. During this time she taught and lectured in schools, colleges and for branches of the Embroiderers’ Guild.',

  "'Conversations With My Mother’, started in 2021, heralds a completely new change of direction in which her Mother has become the subject and focus of new embroideries and monotypes. Through the creative process of making Jenni has discovered a positive way of grieving and the means to become emotionally absorbed in a renewed relationship with her mother."
